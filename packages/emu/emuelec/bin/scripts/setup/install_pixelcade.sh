       Pixelcade LED Installer for EmuELEC : Installer Version $version

This script will install Pixelcade in your /storage/roms folder
Plese ensure you have at least 800 MB of free disk space in /storage/roms
Now connect Pixelcade to a free USB port on your device (Odroid, Android Box, etc)
Ensure the toggle switch on the Pixelcade board is pointing towards USB and not BT
The installer will not run unless the Pixelcade hardware is connected
Grab a coffee or tea as this installer will take around 15 minutes

You may also re-run this installer later to download updated marquee artwork

Would you like to continue?
